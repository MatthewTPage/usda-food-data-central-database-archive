# usda-food-data-central-database-archive

An archive of the USDA food data central database on github for reliability of archiving. Check the releases tab, that's where the download links are.

## License
This data is in the public domain and is from [The USDA's website](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/download-datasets).

## Why?
I'm using this data in a project and want it to decrease the number of dependencies that could cause a fresh deployment to fail. Github is already a dependency so copying the data over to it is ideal.

## New releases
I make no commitment to make new releases as the FDA uploads new data though I could automate it at some point.

## Reliability
I make no commitment to the reliability of the naming of the repo or the username of my account not changing without warning at any point. If you are interested in having a reliable archive of this data to access programatically I would recommend making your own solution.
